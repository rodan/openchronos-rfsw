C code that can run on an Texas Instruments EZ430-Chronos 433MHz watch [1] with a software module that implements interfacing with intertechno radio switches


 forked from:     http://openchronos-ng.sourceforge.net

 Based on a nice tutorial by Christian M. Schmid

 Requirements:

   msp430 toolchain
   python-2.7

 Usage:

 Line1 contains FF.DD

 FF is the decimal notation of the family in which the device is placed [1-16]
                  A is 01, B is 02 ... P is 16.
                  this option must be used for doorbell/PIR device selection
 DD is the decimal notation of the device number [1-16]
                  on some factory remotes devices are placed in 4 groups,
                  in this case device 2 from group 3 is device number 10.
                  special devices like doorbell/PIRs must be set as device number 8.

 Line2 becomes 'on', 'off', 'spe' depending on what command was sent last

  if compile time option CONFIG_MOD_INTERTECHNO_PW is set then the output power is 
 selectable on Line2.

 radio glyphs come up when the command is sent.

 buttons:

 up      - send an 'on' command to the current device
 down    - send an 'off' command
 #       - send a special command (for doorbells/PIRs), make sure DD is 8 in this case.
 long *  - enter config mode. use up, down, # to select family and device, * to save.
